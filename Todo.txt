# Current

issue: key grabbed by other pane
	when dir preview is opened

issue: inotify, focuses main! resize missed when pane is closed

issue: space in names when passing env var to shell

presentation:
	Reduce videos size with H265 encodigng

	script:
		Introduction
			what's in the name
			credit to other
			status
			detail videos

functionality: accept list of virtual files as parameter
		accept them with color
		what do we do with them
			must have at least keyboard handler

		better get code to source
			code can itself get list of virtual files from whereever or generate them

		let user define ftl options?


functionality: get sort and other to work with virtual files
			external commands would fail
				mount a union fs ?


# Later

functionality: undo deletes via rip

functionality: grep in binary files https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all

functionality: drag drop via dragon

arch: multi column attributes
	have a column for entry number, size, etags, access attribute, time, file name, ...
	
	user can add and remove, except file
	user can sort per one or more of the columns 

	columns can be added by background process
		eg: many files need processing and that thats a long time
			list every time a batch is processed

arch: put all options in one array

arch: filter list instead for specialized filters 

arch: filter per directory, inherit from parent

arch: let hidden pane do preview so main pane data isn't overridden by extra pane's
	this may also make it possible to use fz, rg, etc... as filters and ftl as preview
