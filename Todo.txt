# Current

issue: key grabbed by other pane
	when dir preview is opened

issue: inotify, focuses main! resize missed when pane is closed

issue: space in names when passing env var to shell

presentation:
	Reduce videos size with H265 encodigng
		ffmpeg -i Kazam_screencast_00000.mp4 -c:v libx265 kazam_265.mp4

presentation script:
	hello
	what's in the name
	credit to other
	status
	split into multiple videos
	install
	config
	follow the man page

command:
	goto next tag
	goto previous tag

	we need to have a current tag, what happens when that tagged file is untagged?

# Later

arch: multi column attributes
	have a column for entry number, size, etags, access attribute, time, file name, ...
	
	user can add and remove, except file
	user can sort per one or more of the columns 

	columns can be added by background process
		eg: many files need processing and that thats a long time
			list every time a batch is processed

arch: put all options in one array

arch: filter list instead for specialized filters 

arch: filter per directory, inherit from parent

arch: let hidden pane do preview so main pane data isn't overridden by extra pane's
	this may also make it possible to use fz, rg, etc... as filters and ftl as preview
