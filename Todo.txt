# Current

issue: numfmt error after moving files

issue: match preview to object and remove zP
	add hash or timestamp to preview file

issue: space in names when passing env var to shell

issue: pane splitting
	what do we want?
		split the current pane
		keep focus or pass to new split
		split on the other side of the preview

# Later

functionality: git interface
	checkout repo in tmp
	one (virtual) directory per commit
	can search for commit from root
	can go in commits and preview files
	can diff files from commits
	jump from commit to commit on the same file
		highlight the changes

functionality: quit no clear screen

functionality: grep in binary files https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all
		asciio files are compressed can we grep in them?

functionality: drag drop via dragon

functionality: accept list of virtual files as parameter
		in a file
		
		reasons to display virtual files
		
		what to display and how

arch: multi column attributes
	have a column for entry number, size, etags, access attribute, time, file name, ...
	
	user can add and remove, except file
	user can sort per one or more of the columns 
	user can chose which column is displayed and where
	
	columns can be added by background process
		eg: many files need processing and take a long time
			list every time a batch is processed

arch: asynch list display for very large directories
	process1: generate list in background process (filter, color, ...)
	process2: keep the list in memory
	ftl:      query from process2

	optimizations:
		once a directory is processed, setting inotify on it let's us
		update the list and avoid generating the list again
	
	note that ftl already runs process1 in the background 


arch: put all options in one array
	to simplify handling it

arch: filter list instead for specialized filters 
	filters are run in parallel how do we do that with a list?

arch: filter per directory, inherit from parent
	is there a common use case for this?

arch: let hidden pane do preview so main pane data isn't overridden by extra pane's
	this may also make it possible to use fz, rg, etc... as filters and ftl as preview
