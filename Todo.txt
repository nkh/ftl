# Current

issue: numfmt error after moving files

issue: pane splitting
	what do we want?
		split the current pane
		keep focus or pass to new split
		split on the other side of the preview

issue: sometimes the width of pane is wrong
	remember the width used to generate the list, when checking the key also check that 
	we're using the right width otherwise cdir

functionality: run command in preview pane
		one

		constantly
		reset
			same as zv + shell vertical split

		shell vertical split

		shell close

# Later

functionality: make command out of fzf-ftl previewer

functionality: grep in binary files https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all
		asciio files are compressed can we grep in them?

functionality: drag drop via dragon

arch: multi column attributes
	have a column for entry number, size, etags, access attribute, time, file name, ...
	
	user can add and remove, except file
	user can sort per one or more of the columns 
	user can chose which column is displayed and where
	
	columns can be added by background process
		eg: many files need processing and take a long time
			list every time a batch is processed

arch: asynch list display for very large directories
	process1: generate list in background process (filter, color, ...)
	process2: keep the list in memory
	ftl:      query from process2

	optimizations:
		once a directory is processed, setting inotify on it let's us
		update the list and avoid generating the list again
	
	note that ftl already runs process1 in the background 

arch: put all options in one array
	to simplify handling it

arch: filter list instead for specialized filters 
	filters are run in parallel how do we do that with a list?

arch: let hidden pane do preview so main pane data isn't overridden by extra pane's
	this may also make it possible to use fz, rg, etc... as filters and ftl as preview
