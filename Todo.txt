arch: multi column attributes
	have a column for entry number, size, etags, access attribute, time, file name, ...
	
	user can add and remove, except file
	user can sort per one or more of the columns 

	columns can be added by background process
		eg: many files need processing and that thats a long time
			list every time a batch is processed

arch: put all options in one array

arch: filter list instead for specialized filters 

arch: filter per directory, inherit from parent

arch: let hidden pane do preview so main pane data isn't overridden by extra pane's
	this may also make it possible to use fz, rg, etc... as filters and ftl as preview
