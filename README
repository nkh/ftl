#DOCUMENTATION

There are many promising file for the terminal from fff to nnn, ranger, etc ... 

Written in Bash, not my favorite language but it packs a punch (sometimes it punches you).

I wanted a file manager that would use tmux and give "live" preview. I use a tiling manager,
external applications are started as a window on the side of ftl.

##installation

ftl is a single script, put it in the PATH, install the dependencies and run.

##Display

The display consists of a header and a listing of the files in a directory, possibly filtered,
and an optional preview

###header components

directory tilde(filter on) current_file/total_files current_tab/total_tabs selected_files file_stat

###listing

The directory entries are colored with lscolors, if preview is on, a preview pane is displayed

##Image mode

Only show images in the listing and directory preview; with multiple tabs, sorting images is easy.

#TODO

- Handle SIGWINCH
- keyboard buffer flushing
- fzf scripts preview via vim
- vim file opener using ftl
- use inotify
 
#PATCHING ftl (with gratitude to Larry wall, and not just for patch)

There's no documentation, the code is *dense* but the call stack is seldom
more than 2 deep. I Kept the code short, albeit with longer lines.

The description of the main variables and functions should get you going otherwise
send me a mail.

##Variables

dir_file    selected file in a directory, ftl remembers where you were
filters     each tab has its filter
epanes      extra panes 
pane_id     id of preview pane

tfilter     used in image mode
marks       bookmarks, marks=([0]=dir [1]=dir ...), preset bookmarks
tags        list of tagged files
show_dirs   directory toggle
preview_all preview toggle
ifilter     extension of files considered images
zooms       preview pane sizes in percent

##Functions

ftl       variable setup and switch for the commands
cdir      get list of files in directory and colorize them
