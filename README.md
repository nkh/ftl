# DOCUMENTATION

There are many promising file managers for the terminal, from fff to nnn, clifm, ranger, vimfm, broot, etc ... 

ftl is Written in Bash, the language that packs a real punch (and sometimes punches you).

I wanted a file manager that would use tmux and give me "live" preview and works well with my tiling window manager.

*ftl* is quite complete but still in development. It's good enough so I stopped using other programs a while ago.

# MAN PAGE

*ftl* has a complete man page accessible by pressing '?' in *ftl* or the link below.

[Man page](../main/config/ftl/man/ftl.md)

## Installation

There a very simple installer that mirrors my environment. I run
Ubuntu (KUbuntu) and install a few dependencies from source.

Since some dependencies gets build during the install multiple development
environment are also installed.

*ftl* uses full apllications which need to be installed so the disk usage
may be high depending on what options you chose to install. On the other hand
the applications are great and worth having installed even when not using *ftl*.

To install *ftl* you need download the bash INSTALL file

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nkh/ftl/main/INSTALL

Follow the instructions.
