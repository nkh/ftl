# DOCUMENTATION

There are many promising file managers for the terminal, from fff to nnn, clifm, ranger, vimfm, broot, etc ... 

ftl is Written in Bash, the language that packs a real punch (and sometimes punches you).

I wanted a file manager that would use tmux and give me "live" preview and works well with my tiling window manager.

*ftl* is quite complete but still in development. It's good enough so I stopped using other programs a while ago.

# MAN PAGE
