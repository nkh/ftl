.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
ftl
.PP
ftl [-t file] [directory[/file]]
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
-t file file contains paths to files to tag eg: ftl -t <(find -name
\[cq]ftl*\[cq])
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
ftl is hyperothodox file manager with live previews that leverages tmux
and many other programs.
.PP
The display consists of panes containing files listings and optional
preview.
.PP
\f[I]ftl\f[R] can be used as a directory picker (see cdf in the source)
and as a file picker in \f[I]vim\f[R]
.SH CONCEPTS
.SS Hyperorthodoxy
.PP
ftl is hyperothodox, or not at all depending on your preferences, it
starts with two panes, but can have more, one showing you a directory
listing and the other a preview of the current entry.
The outstanding \f[I]tmux\f[R] makes this possible.
.PP
You can choose to remove the preview as well as having multiple panes
showing the same or different directories.
.PP
Panes are independent instances of ftl that work in synch, each pane has
its own tabs, filters, \&...
.SS Live Previews
.PP
The preview pane is not, generally, a static view of the file but,
thanks to \f[I]tmux\f[R], a running program.
If you are positioned on a text file, \f[I]vim\f[R] will be run to
display it.
If you change the position in the listing pane, the preview program is
killed and a new program is started.
.PP
The idea is to use within \f[I]ftl\f[R] what you normally use on the
command line.
New previews are simple to add.
.SS Extended And Detached Viewers
.PP
For some file types, often media types, \f[I]ftl\f[R] can show an
extended view and even start a detached viewer.
See \[lq]## External Viewer\[rq] below and config in
`$FTL_CFG/etc/ftlrc'.
.SS Vim
.PP
\f[I]ftl\f[R] uses the awesome \f[I]vim\f[R], if it\[cq]s not your
favorite editor you can install it just for previewing (and maybe find
it awesome).
Patches for other editors are welcome.
.SS Tabs
.PP
Tabs are views, to same or different directories, in the same pane.
Filters are per tab so you can have two tabs with different filters.
.SS File Listing
.PP
The directory entries are colored with lscolors.
The header consists of:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<directory> [tilde(filter)] <current/total> <tab#> <selected_entries> [file_stat]
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Marks
.PP
You can bookmak locations and jump back to them.
Marks can be set in the configuration file, added for the current
session or made persistent.
.SS Tags/Etags
.PP
You can tag (select) entries, tags are synched between panes when option
\f[I]auto_tag\f[R] is set (set by default).
.PP
Etags is extra information that is optionally prepended to the entries.
.PP
Available etags are:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/nadim/nadim/devel/repositories/ftl 2/14 \[u237A]
 1  08/11/2022-12:00 ftl
    \[u2BA4]     date     \[u2BA5]

/home/nadim/nadim/devel/repositories/ftl 2/14 \[u237A]
 1  M ftl
 1 ?? tags
   \[u2BA4]\[u2BA5] git-status
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Preview
.PP
If preview is on (on by default), a preview pane is displayed.
It can be switched on and off during the session; it\[cq]s size can be
changed.
Some entry types have multiple previews (IE: directories) that can be
accessed with a keyboard shortcut (Alt-gr+v by default)
.SS Filtering
.PP
\f[I]ftl\f[R] can filter the files in the directory to present only
those you want to see.
.PP
See \[lq]## Filtering\[rq] in commands.
.SS Bash
.PP
\f[I]ftl\f[R] is written in Bash, the language that packs a real punch
\&... and sometimes punches you.
It also strives to follow the spirit of unix by reusing what\[cq]s
available.
IT will probably not work in other shells but may be a cool exercise in
making things portable.
.PP
Most of the code is one liners, albeit long, and it\[cq]s structured to
be \f[I]easy\f[R] to expand.
.SH KEY BINDINGS
.PP
\f[I]ftl\f[R] uses vim-like key bindings by default, the bindings are
defined in the default ftlrc file.
.PP
\f[I]ftl\f[R] has many commands and thus many bindings.
The control key is not used but the Alt-gr key, in combination with the
shift key, is used extensively
.SS Default bindings
.PP
`Alt-gr'+c will open a window with all the current binding
.PP
A list of all bindings, in \f[I]fzf\f[R], wich allows you to search per
key or name.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
map    section  key      command                
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ftl    file     c        copy          copy file to, prompts inline
\f[R]
.fi
.SS User defined bindings
.PP
You can override all the keys by creating your own rcfile and using the
\f[I]bind\f[R] function.
See \[lq]## Examples\[rq].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
bind function arguments, all mendatory:

	map		map where the binding is saves 
	section		logical group the binding belongs to (hint)
	key		the keyboard key
	command		name of the internal command that is called
	short_ help	help displayed 
          

eg: bind ftl file k copy \[dq]copy file to, prompts inline\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In the default \f[I]ftlrc\f[R] file, associative arrays A for alt-gr and
SA for shift+Alt-gr are defined, they allow you to define bindings this
way:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
eg: bin ftl filter \[dq]${A[d]}\[dq] clear_filters \[dq]clear filters\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When bindings are shown \f[I]alt-gr\f[R] is replaced by \f[I]\[uA]\f[R]
and \[dq]\f[I]shift+alt-gr\f[R] is replaced by \f[I]\[u21C8]\f[R]; as
well as the key the combination would generate that makes it easier to
search by name or by binding.
.SS Leader key
.PP
The \[lq]Leader key\[rq] is a prefix key used to extend \f[I]ftl\f[R]
shortcuts by using sequences of keys to perform a command.
The default is `\[rs]'
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# set leader to \[dq]space\[dq]
bind ftl bind BACKSPACE_KEY leader_key \[aq]leader key SPACE_KEY

.PP
\f[I]ftl\f[R] has one \f[I]session-shell\f[R], a pane running bash,
where your external commands are run by default.
.PP
\f[I]ftl\f[R] can also run you external commands in a separate shell in
the \f[I]ftl\f[R] session with \f[I]ftl_shell\f[R], this is useful when
running commands that take time to complete.
.PP
You can also run a command on each selected entry with
\f[I]ftl_xargs\f[R].
.PP
When a command fails \f[I]ftl\f[R] will add a `!' in the header.
